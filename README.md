# jira-task-copy-to-clipboard-extension

Adds a `Copy` button beside task titles to copy the task id and task title.

## Why?

Selecting the issue id and title always inserts an endline between them, this was driving me crazy so I made a browser extension to fix this.

## TODO

Don't hardcode jira urls in the rights and use something like Toggl's extension which allows adding dynamic rights from settings page.
