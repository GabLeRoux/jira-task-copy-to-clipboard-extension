# jira-task-copy-to-clipboard-extension

Adds a `Copy` button beside task titles to copy the task id and task title.

## Example

![extension demo](doc/extension-demo.png)

Clicking above button would copy the following: `AWS-42 Configure Jira workflow triggers with Github`

## Why?

Selecting the issue id and title always inserts an endline between them, this was driving me crazy so I made a browser extension to fix this. There is also a copy button in the recent jira version, but it copies the issue url, I did not need that ;)
