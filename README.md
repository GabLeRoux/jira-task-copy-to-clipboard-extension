# jira-task-copy-to-clipboard-extension

Adds a `Copy` button beside task titles to copy the task id and task title.

## Example

![extension demo](doc/extension-demo.png)

Clicking on that `Copy` button would add this to your clipboard:  
`AWS-42 Configure Jira workflow triggers with Github`

## FAQ

### Why?

Selecting the issue id and title always inserts an endline between them, this was driving me crazy so I made a browser extension to fix this. Jira now provides a copy button in more recent versions, but it only copies issue url. I needed something else

### What's the `Start timer` in the screenshot?

See [Toggl button extension](https://github.com/toggl/toggl-button), it's quite handy :)

### Can I contribute?

Yes
